### I am actively searching for a job in games as a programmer/technical designer/game designer
**These repositories are not exhaustive and do not show the full extent of my programming experience.**

I'm a 28 year old South African game developer, looking to transition into AAA or big indie game development. I'm a generalist with a large breadth of experience but I'm looking to specialise. Craving problems to solve and looking for a challenge. I am hungry for opportunity and Iâ€™m ambitious. 

I have ~7 years of game development experience with C# and Microsoft XNA/Monogame (2012-2019). I know C# like the back of my hand, but I'm also proficient in C++ and I know Unreal Engine 4 both C++ and Blueprint.

I started programming when I was 7 and I've been making my own games ever since. I'm passionate about both game programming and design. I'm a good all-rounder having had experience in all areas of game development while developing a game of my own from the ground up without an engine. I have mostly focused on gameplay programming and design, but my experience also includes UI design, graphics programming, testing, getting player feedback, tools development etc. 

I may not have the *exact* experience that youâ€™re looking for but I make up for it with a broad range of skills, talent and a lifetime of passion for games.
